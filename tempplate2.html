            Central to the relationship between poverty and sustainable development is the notion of social equity and inclusion. Sustainable development endeavors to mitigate inequalities by fostering inclusive economic growth, equitable access to education and healthcare, and social protection systems. By addressing systemic barriers and empowering marginalized communities, sustainable development not only lifts individuals out of poverty but also promotes a more just and cohesive society. Thus, by prioritizing social equity alongside economic and environmental sustainability, societies can advance towards a future where poverty is alleviated, and all individuals have equal opportunities to thrive.
            
            
            
            
            
Poverty and sustainable development are deeply intertwined, with the latter offering a framework for addressing the former comprehensively. Sustainable development encompasses economic, social, and environmental dimensions, aiming to meet the needs of present and future generations while eradicating poverty. Inclusive economic growth, access to quality education and healthcare, and environmental sustainability are key pillars in this endeavor. By prioritizing these aspects, societies can create pathways out of poverty while ensuring the well-being of both people and the planet. Thus, sustainable development emerges as a holistic approach to addressing poverty that fosters resilience, equity, and prosperity for all.
